<p>A registered user may respond to notice of takedown by showing either (a) that the claimant does not own the IP or (b) that the IP is not infringed. If the registered user succeeds in showing either (a), (b) or (c) then our Designated Copyright Agent may exercise its discretion not to remove the IP.</p>
<p>If our Designated Copyright Agent decides to comply with a takedown request, it will do so within a reasonably expeditious period of time.</p>
<p>We Have No Obligation to Adjudicate IP Claims – User’s Agreement to Hold Us Harmless From Claims</p>
